![DEMOGRID](https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs/raw/master/demogrid.png)

Welcome .. This repo stores a collection of freely available demos and mini projects for AWS (and in the future other cloud platforms).
These demos are available in three ways:

- Here in instruction & architecture diagram form for free
- Zs part of [https://learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io) courses - including theory lessons and guided videos.
- **Some** of the popular mini projects have been upgraded with video guides on this repo (people buying my courses supports this)

The free versions here are fully functional, with instructions & architecture diagrams and are maintained by me.

All demos have a structure ...
-  Most are started using a `1-Click Deployment` .. click a link, check a box, click a create stack and wait until complete.
- `01_LABSETUP` contains assets required for the DEMO if required - **many are linked directly from the instructions.**
- `02_LABINSTRUCTIONS` contains text instructions and architecture diagrams - **most of these are directly linked from the instructions.**

A full range of Video guided versions are available in my courses at https://learn.cantrill.io

**I give free course credits for any bugs submitted via PR, so please submit fixes for any issues you find.**
