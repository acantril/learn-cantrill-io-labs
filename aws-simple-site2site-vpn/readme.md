# Advanced Demo - Simple Site2Site VPN

In this mini project you will implement a site to site VPN between AWS and a simulated on-premises business site running the pfSense router/NAT software.

The demo consists of 5 stages, each implementing additional components of the architecture  

- Stage 1 - Create Site2Site VPN
- Stage 2 - Configure onpremises Router  
- Stage 3 - Routing & Security
- Stage 4 - Testing
- Stage 6 - Cleanup

![Architecture](TBC)

## 1-Click Install

- Make sure you are logged into AWS and in `us-east-1`
- you will need to approve this [subscription](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp?sku=cphb99lr7icr3n9x6kc3102s5) it's a trial, so you won't be billed anything extra. 
- You will need to have an SSH keypair created in `us-east-1` and select this when using the 1-click deployment below
- Once approved, you can use the one click deployment below.
