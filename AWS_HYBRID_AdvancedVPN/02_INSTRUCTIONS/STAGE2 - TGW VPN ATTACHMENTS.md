# Advanced Highly-Available Dynamic Site-to-Site VPN

In STAGE2 of the DEMO lesson you will be creating two VPN attachments for the Transit GATEWAY
This has the effect of creating two VPN connections ... 1 for each of the customer gateways
Each connection has 2 Tunnels ... one between AWS Endpoint A => Customer Gateway and one between AWS Endpoint B => Customer Gateway
Once the connections have been created, you will download the configuration files which will be required to configure the onpremises VPN endpoints (customer gateways)

You will extract these from three locations  

- Outputs of the ONPREM CFN Stack  
- For Connection1, `CONNECTION1CONFIG.TXT`  
- For Connection2, `CONNECTION2CONFIG.TXT`  

Go ahead and populate that template using the instructions in the template
