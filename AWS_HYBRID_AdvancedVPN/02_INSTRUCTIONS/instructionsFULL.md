# Advanced Highly-Available Dynamic Site-to-Site VPN

# STAGE 1A - INITIAL SETUP OF AWS ENVIRONMENT AND SIMULATED ON-PREMISES ENVIRONMENT

- Apply `ADVS2SVPN-AWS.yaml` to the `us-east-1` region in your AWS account (Call it `AWS`) - If prompted ... check capabilities Box
- Apply `ADVS2SVPN-ONPREM.yaml` to the `us-east-1` region in your AWS account (Call it `ONPREM`) - If prompted ... check capabilities Box

Wait for both stacks to move into a `CREATE_COMPLETE` status **Estimated time to complete 5-10 mins**

# STAGE 1B - CREATE CUSTOMER GATEWAY OBJECTS 

Open a new tab to the VPC Console
Open a new tab to CloudFormation Console
In the cloudFormation Tab
Click ONPREM stack
Click Outputs
Note down IP for `Router1Public` and `Router2Public`

In the VPC Console https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?region=us-east-1#
Select `Customer Gateways` under `Virtual private Network (VPN)`
Click `Create Customer gateway`
Set Name to `ONPREM-ROUTER1`
Click `Dynamic` for routing
Set BGP ASN to `65016`
Set IP Address to Router1 Public IP
