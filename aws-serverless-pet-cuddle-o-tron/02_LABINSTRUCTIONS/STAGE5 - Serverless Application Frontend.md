# Advanced Demo Serverless Application - Pet-Cuddle-O-Tron
In this _Advanced Demo_ you will be implementing a serverless reminder application.
The application will load from an S3 bucket and run in browser
.. communicating with Lambda and Step functions via an API Gateway Endpoint
Using the application you will be able to configure reminders for 'pet cuddles' to be send using email and SMS.

This advanced demo consists of 6 stages :-

- STAGE 1 : Configure Simple Email service 
- STAGE 2 : Add a email lambda function to use SES to send emails for the serverless application 
- STAGE 3 : Implement and configure the state machine, the core of the application 
- STAGE 4 : Implement the API Gateway, API and supporting lambda function 
- STAGE 5 : Implement the static frontend application and test functionality **<= THIS STAGE**
- STAGE 6 : Cleanup the account


In this stage of the application you will create an S3 bucket and static website hosting which will host the application front end.  
You will download the source files for the front end, configure them to connect to your specific API gateway and then upload them to S3.
Finally, you will run some application tests to verify its functionality.

# STAGE 5A - CREATE THE S3 BUCKET

Move to the S3 Console https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-east-1#
Click `Create bucket`  
Choose a unique bucket name
Ensure the region is set to `US East (N.Virginia) us-east-1`  
Scroll Down and **UNTICK** `Block all public access`  
Tick the box under `Turning off block all public access might result in this bucket and the objects within becoming public` to acknowledge you understand that you can make the bucket public.  
Scroll Down to the bottom and click `Create bucket`  


# STAGE 5B - SET THE BUCKET AS PUBLIC

Go into the bucket you just created.  
Click the `Permissions` tab.  
Scroll down and in the `Bucket Policy` area, click `Edit`. 


in the box, paste the code below

```
{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement":[
      {
        "Sid":"PublicRead",
        "Effect":"Allow",
        "Principal": "*",
        "Action":["s3:GetObject"],
        "Resource":["REPLACEME_PET_CUDDLE_O_TRON_BUCKET_ARN/*"]
      }
    ]
  }

```
Replace the `REPLACEME_PET_CUDDLE_O_TRON_BUCKET_ARN` (being careful NOT to remove the `/*`) with the bucket ARN, which you can see near to `Bucket ARN `
Click `Save Changes`  


# STAGE 5C - ENABLE STATIC HOSTING
Next you need to enable static hosting on the S3 bucket so that it can be used as a front end website.  
Click on the `Properties Tab`  
Scroll down and locate `Static website hosting`  
Click `Edit`  
Select `Enable` 
Select `Host a static website`  
For both `Index Document` and `Error Document` enter `index.html` 
Click `Save Changes`  
Scroll down and locate `Static website hosting` again.  
Under `Bucket Website Endpoint` copy and note down the bucket endpoint URL.  


# STAGE 5D - DOWNLOAD AND EDIT THE FRONT END FILES

Download and extra this ZIP file https://learn-cantrill-labs.s3.amazonaws.com/aws-serverless-pet-cuddle-o-tron/serverless_frontend.zip
Inside the serverless_frontend folder are the front end files for the serverless website :-

- index.html .. the main index page
- main.css .. the stylesheet for the page
- whiskers.png .. an image of whiskers !!
- serverless.js .. the JS code which runs in your browser. It responds when buttons are clicked, and passes and text from the boxes when it calls the API Gateway endpoint.  

Open the `serverless.js` in a code/text editor.
Locate the placeholder `REPLACEME_API_GATEWAY_INVOKE_URL` . replace it with your API Gateway Invoke URL
at the end of this URL.. add `/petcuddleotron`
it should look something like this `https://somethingsomething.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/petcuddleotron` 
Save the file.  

# STAGE 5E - UPLOAD AND TEST

Return to the S3 console
Click on the `Objects` Tab.  
Click `Upload`  
Drag the 4 files from the serverless_frontend folder onto this tab, including the serverless.js file you just edited.
**MAKE SURE ITS THE EDITED VERSION**

Click `Upload` and wait for it to complete.  
Click `Exit`  
Verify All 4 files are in the `Objects` area of the bucket.  


Open the `PetCuddleOTron URL` you just noted down in a new tab.  
What you are seeing is a simple HTML web page created by the HTML file itself and the `main.css` stylesheet.
When you click buttons .. that calls the `.js` file which is the starting point for the serverless application

Ok to test the application
Enter an amount of time until the next cuddle ...I suggest `120` seconds
Enter a message, i suggest `HUMAN COME HOME NOW`  
then enter the `PetCuddleOTron Customer Address` in the email box, this is the email which you verified right at the start as the customer for this application.  
then enter your cell/mobile number in full international format in the next box

**before you do the next step and click the button on the application, if you want to see how the application works do the following**
open a new tab to the `Step functions console` https://console.aws.amazon.com/states/home?region=us-east-1#/statemachines  
Click on `PetCuddleOTron`  
Click on the `Logging` tab, you will see no logs
CLick on the `Executions` tab, you will see no executions..

Move back to the web application tab (s3 bucket)  
then click on `LEVEL3 : ALL THE THINGS` to send both an email and SMS reminder

Got back to the Step functions console
make sure the `Executions` Tab is selected
click the `Refresh` Icon
Click the `execution`  
Watch the graphic .. see how the `Timer state` is highlighted
The step function is now executing and it has its own state ... its a serverless flow.
Keep waiting, and after 120 seconds the visual will update showing the flow through the state machine

- Timer .. waits 120 seconds
- ChoiceState ... moves to the parallel state because you clicked on the `LEVEL3 ALL THE THINGS` button to send email and SMS
- Then `ParallelSMS` uses SNS directly to send a text message
- `ParallelEmail` invokes the lambda function to send an email
- `NextState` in then moved through, then finally `END`

Scroll to the top, click `ExeuctionInput` and you can see the information entered on the webpage.
This was send it, via the `JS` running in browser, to the API gateway, to the `api_lambda` then through to the `statemachine`

Click `PetCuddleOTron` at the top of the page  
Click on the `Logging` Tab  
Because the roles you created had `CWLogs` permissions the state machine is able to log to CWLogs
Review the logs and ensure you are happy with the flow.  

# STAGE 5 - FINISH

At this point thats everything .. you now have a fully functional serverless application

- Loads HTML & JS From S3 & Static hosting
- Communicates via `JS` to API Gateway 
- uses `api_lambda` as backing resource
- runs a statemachine passing in parameters
- state machine sends email, SMS or both
- state machine terminates

No servers were harmed, or used even, in this production :)

Thats everything for this advanced demo, in STAGE6 you will clear up all of the services used for this advanced demo.
