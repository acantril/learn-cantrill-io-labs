# Advanced Demo - Web App - Single Server to Elastic Evolution

Welcome back, in stage 4 of this demo series you will be creating an EFS file system designed to store the wordpress locally stored media. This area stores any media for posts uploaded when creating the post as well as theme data.  By storing this on a shared file system it means that the data can be used across all instances in a consistent way, and it lives on past the lifetime of the instance.  

# STAGE 4A - Create EFS File System

## File System Settings

Move to the EFS Console https://console.aws.amazon.com/efs/home?region=us-east-1#/get-started  
Click on `Create file System`  
We're going to step through the full configuration options, so click on `Customize`  
For `Name` type `A4L-WORDPRESS-CONTENT`  
This is critical data so for `Availability and Durability` leave this set to `Regional` and ensure `Enable Automatic Backups` is enabled.  
for `LifeCycle management` leave as the default of `30 days since last access`  
You have two `performance modes` to pick, choose `General Purpose` as MAX I/O is for very spefific high performance scenarios.  
for `Throughput mode` pick `bursting` which links performance to how much space you consume. The more consumed, the higher performance. The other option Provisioned allows for performance to be specified independant of consumption.  
Untick `Enable encryption of data at rest` .. in production you would leave this on, but for this demo which focusses on architecture it simplifies the implementation.  
Click `Next`

## Network Settings

In this part you will be configuing the EFS `Mount Targets` which are the network interfaces in the VPC which your instances will connect with.  

In the `Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)` dropdown select `A4LVPC`  
You should see 3 rows.  
Make sure `us-east-1a`, `us-east-1b` & `us-east-1c` are selected in each row.  
In `us-east-1a` row, select `sn-App-A` in the subnet ID dropdown, and in the security groups dropdown select `A4LVPC-SGEFS` & remove the default security group  
In `us-east-1b` row, select `sn-App-B` in the subnet ID dropdown, and in the security groups dropdown select `A4LVPC-SGEFS` & remove the default security group  
In `us-east-1c` row, select `sn-App-C` in the subnet ID dropdown, and in the security groups dropdown select `A4LVPC-SGEFS` & remove the default security group  

Click `next`  
Leave all these options as default and click `next`  
We wont be setting a file system policy so click `Create`  

The file system will start in the `Creating` State and then move to `Available` once it does..  
Click on the file system to enter it and click `Network`  
Scroll down and all the mount points will show as `creating` keep hitting refresh and wait for all 3 to show as available before moving on.  

Note down the `fs-XXXXXXXX` file system ID once visible at the top of this screen, you will need it in the next step.  


# STAGE 4B - Add an fsid to parameter store

Now that the file system has been created, you need to add another parameter store value for the file system ID so that the automatically built instance(s) can load this safely.

Move to the Systems Manager console https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/home?region=us-east-1#  
Click on `Parameter Store` on the left menu  
Click `Create Parameter`  
Under `Name` enter `/A4L/Wordpress/EFSFSID` 
Under `Description` enter `File System ID for Wordpress Content (wp-content)`  
for `Tier` set `Standard`  
For `Type` set `String`  
for `Data Type` set `text`  
for `Value` set the file system ID `fs-XXXXXXX` which you just noted down (use your own file system ID)  
Click `Create Parameter`  


# STAGE 4C - Connect the file system to the EC2 instance & copy data

Open the EC2 console and go to running instances https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#Instances:sort=desc:tag:Name  
Select the `Wordpress-LT` instance, right click, `Connect`, Select `Session Manager` and click `Connect`  
type `sudo bash` and press enter   
type `cd` and press enter  
type `clear` and press enter  

First we need to install the amazon EFS utilities to allow the instance to connect to EFS. EFS is based on NFS which is standard but the EFS tooling makes things easier.  

```
sudo yum -y install amazon-efs-utils
```

next you need to migrate the existing media content from wp-content into EFS, and this is a multi step process.

First, copy the content to a temporary location and make a new empty folder.

```
cd /var/www/html
sudo mv wp-content/ /tmp
sudo mkdir wp-content
```

then get the efs file system ID from parameter store

```
EFSFSID=$(aws ssm get-parameters --region us-east-1 --names /A4L/Wordpress/EFSFSID --query Parameters[0].Value)
EFSFSID=`echo $EFSFSID | sed -e 's/^"//' -e 's/"$//'`

cat /etc/fstab
```

Next .. add a line to /etc/fstab to configure the EFS file system to mount as /var/www/html/wp-content/

```
echo -e "$EFSFSID:/ /var/www/html/wp-content efs _netdev,tls,iam 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
cat /etc/fstab
mount -a -t efs defaults
df -k
```

now we need to copy the origin content data back in and fix permissions

```
mv /tmp/wp-content/* /var/www/html/wp-content/
chown -R ec2-user:apache /var/www/

```

# STAGE 4D - Test that the wordpress app can load the media

run the following command to reboot the EC2 wordpress instance
```
reboot
```
(=> outputs: Terminated)

Once it restarts, ensure that you can still load the wordpress blog which is now loading the media from EFS.  

# STAGE 4E - Update the launch template with the config to automate the EFS part

Next you will update the launch template so that it automatically mounts the EFS file system during its provisioning process. This means that in the next stage, when you add autoscaling, all instances will have access to the same media store ...allowing the platform to scale.

Go to the EC2 console https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#Home:  
Click `Launch Templates`  
Check the box next to the `Wordpress` launch template, click `Actions` and click `Modify Template (Create New Version)`  
for `Template version description` enter `App only, uses EFS filesystem defined in /A4L/Wordpress/EFSFSID`  
Scroll to the bottom and expand `Advanced Details`  
Scroll to the bottom and find `User Data` expand the entry box as much as possible.  

After `#!/bin/bash -xe` position cursor at the end & press enter twice to add new lines
paste in this

```
EFSFSID=$(aws ssm get-parameters --region us-east-1 --names /A4L/Wordpress/EFSFSID --query Parameters[0].Value)
EFSFSID=`echo $EFSFSID | sed -e 's/^"//' -e 's/"$//'`

```

Find the line which says `yum install -y mariadb-server httpd wget`
after `wget` add a space and paste in `amazon-efs-utils`  
it should now look like `yum install -y mariadb-server httpd wget amazon-efs-utils`  

locate `systemctl start httpd` position cursor at the end & press enter twice to add new lines  

paste in the following

```
mkdir -p /var/www/html/wp-content
chown -R ec2-user:apache /var/www/
echo -e "$EFSFSID:/ /var/www/html/wp-content efs _netdev,tls,iam 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
mount -a -t efs defaults
```

Scroll down and click `Create template version`  
Click `View Launch Template`  
Select the template again (dont click)
Click `Actions` and select `Set Default Version`  
Under `Template version` select `3`  
Click `Set as default version`  



# STAGE 4 - FINISH  

This configuration has several limitations :-

- ~~The application and database are built manually, taking time and not allowing automation~~ FIXED  
- ~~^^ it was slow and annoying ... that was the intention.~~ FIXED  
- ~~The database and application are on the same instance, neither can scale without the other~~ FIXED  
- ~~The database of the application is on an instance, scaling IN/OUT risks this media~~ FIXED  
- ~~The application media and UI store is local to an instance, scaling IN/OUT risks this media~~ FIXED  

- Customer Connections are to an instance directly ... no health checks/auto healing
- The IP of the instance is hardcoded into the database ....


You can now move onto STAGE 5
