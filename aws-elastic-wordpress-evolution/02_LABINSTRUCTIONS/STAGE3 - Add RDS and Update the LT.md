# Advanced Demo - Web App - Single Server to Elastic Evolution

![Stage3 - PNG](https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs/blob/master/aws-elastic-wordpress-evolution/02_LABINSTRUCTIONS/STAGE3%20-%20SPLIT%20OUT%20RDS.png)

In stage 3 you will be splitting out the database functionality from the EC2 instance .. running MariaDB to an RDS instance running the MySQL Engine.  
This will allow the DB and Instance to scale independently, and will allow the data to be secure past the lifetime of the EC2 instance.  

# STAGE 3A - Create RDS Subnet Group

A subnet group is what allows RDS to select from a range of subnets to put its databases inside  
In this case you will give it a selection of 3 subnets sn-db-A / B and C  
RDS can then decide freely which to use.  

Move to the RDS Console https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home?region=us-east-1#  
Click `Subnet Groups`  
Click `Create DB Subnet Group`  
Under `Name` enter `WordPressRDSSubNetGroup`  
Under `Description` enter `RDS Subnet Group for WordPress`  
Under `VPC` select `A4LVPC`  

Under `Add subnets` 
In `Availability Zones` select `us-east-1a` & `us-east-1b` & `us-east-1c`  
Under `Subnets` check the box next to 

- 10.16.16.0/20 (this is sn-db-A)
- 10.16.80.0/20 (this is sn-db-B)
- 10.16.144.0/20 (this is sn-db-C)

Click `Create`  

# STAGE 3B - Create RDS Instance

In this sub stage of the demo, you are going to provision an RDS instance using the subnet group to control placement within the VPC.   
Normally you would use multi-az for production, to keep costs low, for now you should use a single AZ as per the instructions below.  

Click `Databases`  
Click `Create Database`  
Click `Standard Create`  
Click `MySql`  
Under `Version` select `MySQL 8.0.32`   

Scroll down and select `Free Tier` under templates
_this ensures there will be no costs for the database but it will be single AZ only_

under `Db instance identifier` enter `a4lWordPress`
under `Master Username` enter `a4lwordpressuser`  
under `Master Password` and `Confirm Password` enter `4n1m4l54L1f3`   

Under `DB Instance size`, then `DB instance class`, then `Burstable classes (includes t classes)` make sure db.t3.micro or db.t2.micro or db.t4g.micro is selected  

Scroll down, under `Connectivity`, `Compute resource` select `Donâ€™t connect to an EC2 compute resource`  
under `Connectivity`, `Network type` select `IPv4`  
under `Connectivity`, `Virtual private cloud (VPC)` select `A4LVPC`  
under `Subnet group` that `wordpressrdssubnetgroup` is selected  
Make sure `Public Access` is set to `No`  
Under `VPC security groups` make sure `choose existing` is selected, remove `default` and add `A4LVPC-SG-Database`  
Under `Availability Zone` set `us-east-1a`  

**IMPORTANT .. DON'T MISS THIS STEP**
Scroll down past `Database Authentication` & `Monitoring` and expand `Additional configuration`  
in the `Initial database name` box enter `a4lwordpressdb`  
Scroll to the bottom and click `create Database`  

** this will take anywhere up to 30 minutes to create ... it will need to be fully ready before you move to the next step - coffee time !!!! **

# STAGE 3C - Migrate WordPress data from MariaDB to RDS

Open the EC2 Console https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#Home:  
Click `Instances`  
Locate the `WordPress-LT` instance, right click, `Connect` and choose `Session Manager` and then click `Connect`  
Type `sudo bash`  
Type `cd`  
Type `clear`  

## Populate Environment Variables

You're going to do an export of the SQL database running on the local ec2 instance

First run these commands to populate variables with the data from Parameter store, it avoids having to keep locating passwords  
```
DBPassword=$(aws ssm get-parameters --region us-east-1 --names /A4L/Wordpress/DBPassword --with-decryption --query Parameters[0].Value)
DBPassword=`echo $DBPassword | sed -e 's/^"//' -e 's/"$//'`

DBRootPassword=$(aws ssm get-parameters --region us-east-1 --names /A4L/Wordpress/DBRootPassword --with-decryption --query Parameters[0].Value)
DBRootPassword=`echo $DBRootPassword | sed -e 's/^"//' -e 's/"$//'`

DBUser=$(aws ssm get-parameters --region us-east-1 --names /A4L/Wordpress/DBUser --query Parameters[0].Value)
DBUser=`echo $DBUser | sed -e 's/^"//' -e 's/"$//'`

DBName=$(aws ssm get-parameters --region us-east-1 --names /A4L/Wordpress/DBName --query Parameters[0].Value)
DBName=`echo $DBName | sed -e 's/^"//' -e 's/"$//'`

DBEndpoint=$(aws ssm get-parameters --region us-east-1 --names /A4L/Wordpress/DBEndpoint --query Parameters[0].Value)
DBEndpoint=`echo $DBEndpoint | sed -e 's/^"//' -e 's/"$//'`

```

## Take a Backup of the local DB

To take a backup of the database run

```
mysqldump -h $DBEndpoint -u $DBUser -p$DBPassword $DBName > a4lWordPress.sql
```
** in production you wouldnt put the password in the CLI like this, its a security risk since a ps -aux can see it .. but security isnt the focus of this demo its the process of rearchitecting **

## Restore that Backup into RDS

Move to the RDS Console https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home?region=us-east-1#databases:  
Click the `a4lWordPressdb` instance  
Copy the `endpoint` into your clipboard  
Move to the Parameter store https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/parameters?region=us-east-1  
Check the box next to `/A4L/Wordpress/DBEndpoint` and click `Delete` (please do delete this, not just edit the existing one)  
Click `Create Parameter`  

Under `Name` enter `/A4L/Wordpress/DBEndpoint`  
Under `Descripton` enter `WordPress DB Endpoint Name`  
Under `Tier` select `Standard`    
Under `Type` select `String`  
Under `Data Type` select `text`  
Under `Value` enter the RDS endpoint endpoint you just copied  
Click `Create Parameter`  

Update the DbEndpoint environment variable with 

```
DBEndpoint=$(aws ssm get-parameters --region us-east-1 --names /A4L/Wordpress/DBEndpoint --query Parameters[0].Value)
DBEndpoint=`echo $DBEndpoint | sed -e 's/^"//' -e 's/"$//'`
```

Restore the database export into RDS using

```
mysql -h $DBEndpoint -u $DBUser -p$DBPassword $DBName < a4lWordPress.sql 
```

## Change the WordPress config file to use RDS

this command will substitute `localhost` in the config file for the contents of `$DBEndpoint` which is the RDS instance

```
sudo sed -i "s/'localhost'/'$DBEndpoint'/g" /var/www/html/wp-config.php
```


# STAGE 3D - Stop the MariaDB Service

```
sudo systemctl disable mariadb
sudo systemctl stop mariadb
```


# STAGE 3E - Test WordPress

Move to the EC2 Console https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#Instances:sort=desc:tag:Name  
Select the `WordPress-LT` Instance  
copy the `IPv4 Public IP` into your clipboard  
Open the IP in a new tab  
You should see the blog, working, even though MariaDB on the EC2 instance is stopped and disabled
Its now running using RDS  

# STAGE 3F - Update the LT so it doesnt install 

Move to the EC2 Console https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#Home:  
Under `Instances` click `Launch Templates`  
Select the `WordPress` launch Template (select, dont click)
Click `Actions` and `Modify Template (Create new version)`  
This template version will be based on the existing version ... so many of the values will be populated already  
Under `Template version description` enter `Single server App Only - RDS DB`

Scroll down to `Advanced details` and expand it  
Scroll down to `User Data` and expand the text box as much as possible


Locate and remove the following lines

```
systemctl enable mariadb
systemctl start mariadb
mysqladmin -u root password $DBRootPassword


echo "CREATE DATABASE $DBName;" >> /tmp/db.setup
echo "CREATE USER '$DBUser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '$DBPassword';" >> /tmp/db.setup
echo "GRANT ALL ON $DBName.* TO '$DBUser'@'localhost';" >> /tmp/db.setup
echo "FLUSH PRIVILEGES;" >> /tmp/db.setup
mysql -u root --password=$DBRootPassword < /tmp/db.setup
rm /tmp/db.setup

```


Click `Create Template Version`  
Click `View Launch Template`  
Select the template again (dont click)
Click `Actions` and select `Set Default Version`  
Under `Template version` select `2`  
Click `Set as default version`  

# STAGE 3 - FINISH  

This configuration has several limitations :-

- ~~The application and database are built manually, taking time and not allowing automation~~ FIXED  
- ~~^^ it was slow and annoying ... that was the intention.~~ FIXED  
- ~~The database and application are on the same instance, neither can scale without the other~~ FIXED  
- ~~The database of the application is on an instance, scaling IN/OUT risks this media~~ FIXED  

- The application media and UI store is local to an instance, scaling IN/OUT risks this media
- Customer Connections are to an instance directly ... no health checks/auto healing
- The IP of the instance is hardcoded into the database ....


You can now move onto STAGE 4
