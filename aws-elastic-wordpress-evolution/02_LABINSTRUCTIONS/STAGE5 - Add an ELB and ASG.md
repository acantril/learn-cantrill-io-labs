![Stage5 - PNG](https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs/blob/master/aws-elastic-wordpress-evolution/02_LABINSTRUCTIONS/STAGE5%20-%20ASG%20%26%20ALB.png)

In stage 5 of this advanced demo lesson, you will be adding an auto scaling group to provision and terminate instances automatically based on load on the system.  

You have already performed all of the preparation steps required, by moving data storage onto RDS, media storage onto EFS and creating a launch template to automatically build the wordpress application servers.


# STAGE 5A - Create the load balancer

Move to the EC2 console https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#Home:  
Click `Load Balancers` under `Load Balancing`  
Click `Create Load Balancer`  
Click `Create` under `Application Load Balancer`  
Under name enter `A4LWORDPRESSALB`  
Ensure `internet-facing` is selected  
ensure `ipv4` selected for `IP Address type`  

Under `Network Mapping` select `A4LVPC` in the `VPC Dropdown`  
Check the boxes next to `us-east-1a` `us-east-1b` and `us-east-1c`  
Select `sn-pub-A`, `sn-pub-B` and `sn-pub-C` for each.  

Scroll down and under `Security Groups` remove `default` and select the `A4LVPC-SGLoadBalancer` from the dropdown.  

Under `Listener and Routing` 
Ensure `Protocol` is set to `HTTP` and `Port` is set to `80`.  
Click `Create target group` which will open a new tab  
for `Target Type` choose `Instances` 
for Target group name choose `A4LWORDPRESSALBTG`  
For `Protocol` choose `HTTP`  
For `Port` choose `80`  
Make sure the `VPC` is set to `A4LVPC`  
Check that `Protocol Version` is set to `HTTP1`  

Under `Health checks`
for `Protocol` choose `HTTP`
and for `Path` choose `/`  
Click `Next`  
We wont register any right now so click `Create target Group`  
Go back to the previous tab where you are creating the Load Balancer
Click the `Refresh Icon` and select the `A4LWORDPRESSALBTG` item in the dropdown.  
Scroll down to the bottom and click `Create load balancer`  
Click `View Load Balancer` and select the load balancer you are creating.  
Scroll down and copy the `DNS Name` into your clipboard  

# STAGE 5B - Create a new Parameter store value with the ELB DNS name

Move to the systems manager console https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/home?region=us-east-1#  
Click `Parameter Store`  
Click `Create Parameter`  
Under `Name` enter `/A4L/Wordpress/ALBDNSNAME` 
Under `Description` enter `DNS Name of the Application Load Balancer for wordpress`  
for `Tier` set `Standard`  
For `Type` set `String`  
for `Data Type` set `text`  
for `Value` set the DNS name of the load balancer you copied into your clipboard
Click `Create Parameter` 

# STAGE 5C - Update the Launch template to wordpress is updated with the ELB DNS as its home

Go to the EC2 console https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#Home:  
CLick `Launch Templates`  
Check the box next to the `Wordpress` launch template, click `Actions` and click `Modify Template (Create New Version)`  
for `Template version description` enter `App only, uses EFS filesystem defined in /A4L/Wordpress/EFSFSID, ALB home added to WP Database`  
Scroll to the bottom and expand `Advanced Details`  
Scroll to the bottom and find `User Data` expand the entry box as much as possible.  

After `#!/bin/bash -xe` position cursor at the end & press enter twice to add new lines
paste in this

```
ALBDNSNAME=$(aws ssm get-parameters --region us-east-1 --names /A4L/Wordpress/ALBDNSNAME --query Parameters[0].Value)
ALBDNSNAME=`echo $ALBDNSNAME | sed -e 's/^"//' -e 's/"$//'`

```

Move all the way to the bottom of the `User Data` and paste in this block

```
cat >> /home/ec2-user/update_wp_ip.sh<< 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
source <(php -r 'require("/var/www/html/wp-config.php"); echo("DB_NAME=".DB_NAME."; DB_USER=".DB_USER."; DB_PASSWORD=".DB_PASSWORD."; DB_HOST=".DB_HOST); ')
SQL_COMMAND="mysql -u $DB_USER -h $DB_HOST -p$DB_PASSWORD $DB_NAME -e"
OLD_URL=$($SQL_COMMAND 'select option_value from wp_options where option_name = '"'"'home'"'"';' | grep http)

ALBDNSNAME=$(aws ssm get-parameters --region us-east-1 --names /A4L/Wordpress/ALBDNSNAME --query Parameters[0].Value)
ALBDNSNAME=`echo $ALBDNSNAME | sed -e 's/^"//' -e 's/"$//'`

$SQL_COMMAND "UPDATE wp_options SET option_value = replace(option_value, '$OLD_URL', 'http://$ALBDNSNAME') WHERE option_name = 'home' OR option_name = 'siteurl';"
$SQL_COMMAND "UPDATE wp_posts SET guid = replace(guid, '$OLD_URL','http://$ALBDNSNAME');"
$SQL_COMMAND "UPDATE wp_posts SET post_content = replace(post_content, '$OLD_URL', 'http://$ALBDNSNAME');"
$SQL_COMMAND "UPDATE wp_postmeta SET meta_value = replace(meta_value,'$OLD_URL','http://$ALBDNSNAME');"
EOF

chmod 755 /home/ec2-user/update_wp_ip.sh
echo "/home/ec2-user/update_wp_ip.sh" >> /etc/rc.local
/home/ec2-user/update_wp_ip.sh
```

Scroll down and click `Create template version`  
Click `View Launch Template`  
Select the template again (dont click)
Click `Actions` and select `Set Default Version`  
Under `Template version` select `4`  
Click `Set as default version`  


# STAGE 5D - Create an auto scaling group (no scaling yet)

Move to the EC2 console  
under `Auto Scaling`  
click `Auto Scaling Groups`  
Click `Create an Auto Scaling Group`  
For `Auto Scaling group name` enter `A4LWORDPRESSASG`  
Under `Launch Template` select `Wordpress`  
Under `Version` select `Latest`  
Scroll down and click `Next`  
For `Network` `VPC` select `A4LVPC`  
For `Subnets` select `sn-Pub-A`, `sn-pub-B` and `sn-pub-C`  
Click `next`  

# STAGE 5E - Integrate ASG and ALB

Its here where we integrate the ASG with the Load Balancer. Load balancers actually work (for EC2) with static instance registrations. What ASG does, it link with a target group, any instances provisioned by the ASG are added to the target group, anything terminated is removed.  

Check the `Attach to an existing Load balancer` box  
Ensure `Choose from your load balancer target groups` is selected.  
for `existing load balancer targer groups` select `A4LWORDPRESSALBTG`  
don't make any changes to `VPC Lattice integration options`  

Under `health Checks` check `Turn on Elastic Load Balancing health checks`  
Under `Additional Settings` check `Enable group metrics collection within CloudWatch`  


Scroll down and click `Next`  

For now leave `Desired` `Mininum` and `Maximum` at `1`   
For `Scaling policies - optional` leave it on `None`  
Make sure `Enable instance scale-in protection` is **NOT** checked  
Click `Next`  
We wont be adding notifications so click `Next` Again  
Click `Add Tag`  
for `Key` enter `Name` and for `Value` enter `Wordpress-ASG` 
make sure `Tag New instances` is checked
Click `Next` 
Click `Create Auto Scaling Group`  

Right click on instances and open in a new tab  
Right click Wordpress-LT, `Terminate Instance` and confirm.   
This removes the old manually created wordpress instance
Click `Refresh` and you should see a new instance being created... `Wordpress-ASG` this is the one created automatically by the ASG using the launch template - this is because the desired capacity is set to `1` and we currently have `0`  


# STAGE 5F - Add scaling

Move to the AWS Console https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/autoscaling/home?region=us-east-1#AutoScalingGroups:  
Click `Auto Scaling Groups`  
Click the `A4LWORDPRESSASG` ASG  
Click the `Automatic SCaling` Tab  

We're going to add two policies, scale in and scale out.

## SCALEOUT when CPU usage on average is above 40%

Click `Create dynamic Scaling Policy`  
For policy `type` select `Simple scaling`  
for `Scaling Policy name` enter `HIGHCPU`  
Click `Create a CloudWatch Alarm`  
Click `Select Metric`  
Click `EC2`  
Click `By Auto Scaling Group` (if this doesn't show in your list, wait a while and refresh)  
Check `A4LWORDPRESSASG CPU Utilization`  (if this doesn't show in your list, wait a while and refresh)  
Click `Select Metric`  
Scroll Down... select `Threashhold style` `static`, select `Greater` and enter `40` in the `than` box and click `Next`
Click `Remove` next to notification if you see anything listed here
Click `Next`
Enter `WordpressHIGHCPU` in `Alarm Name`  
Click `Next`  
Click `Create Alarm`  
Go back to the AutoScalingGroup tab and click the `Refresh SYmbol` next to Cloudwatch Alarm  
Click the dropdown and select `WordpressHIGHCPU`  
For `Take the action` choose `Add` `1` Capacity units  
Click `Create`


## SCALEIN when CPU usage on average ie below 40%

Click `Create Dynamic Scaling Policy`  
For policy `type` select `Simple scaling`  
for `Scaling Policy name` enter `LOWCPU`  
Click `Create a CloudWatch Alarm`  
Click `Select Metric`  
Click `EC2`  
Click `By Auto Scaling Group`
Check `A4LWORDPRESSASG CPU Utilization`  
Click `Select Metric`  
Scroll Down... select `Static`, `Lower` and enter `40` in the `than` box and click `next`
Click `Remove` next to notification
Click `Next`
Enter `WordpressLOWCPU` in `Alarm Name`  
Click `Next`  
Click `Create Alarm`  
Go back to the AutoScalingGroup tab and click the `Refresh Symbol` next to Cloudwatch Alarm  
Click the dropdown and select `WordpressLOWCPU`  
For `Take the action` choose `Remove` `1` Capacity units  
Click `Create`

## ADJUST ASG Values

Click `Details Tab`  
Under `Group Details` click `Edit`  
Set `Desired 1`, Minimum `1` and Maximum `3`  
Click `Update`  

# STAGE 5G - Test Scaling & Self Healing

Open Auto Scaling Groups in a new tab https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2autoscaling/home?region=us-east-1#/details  
Open that Auto scaling group in that tab and click on `Activity` tab
Go to running instances in the EC2 Console https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#Instances:sort=desc:tag:Name  in a new tab  

Simulate some load on the wordpress instance  

Select the/one running `Wordpress-ASG` instance, right click, `Connect`, Select `Session Manager` and click `Connect`  
type `sudo bash` and press enter   
type `cd` and press enter  
type `clear` and press enter  

run `stress -c 2 -v -t 3000`

this stresses the CPU on the instance, while running go to the ASG tag, and refresh the activities tab. it might take a few minutes, but the ASG will detect high CPU load and begin provisioning a new EC2 instance. 
if you want to see the monitoring stats, change to the monitoring tag on the ASG Console
Check `enable` next to Auto Scaling Group Metrics Collection

At some point another instance will be added. This will be auto built based on the launch template, connect to the RDS instance and EFS file system and add another instance of capacity to the platform.
Try terminating one of the EC2 instances ...
Watch what happens in the activity tab of the auto scaling group console.
This is an example of self-healing, a new instance is provisioned to take the old ones place.

# STAGE 5 - FINISH  

This configuration has several limitations :-

- ~~The application and database are built manually, taking time and not allowing automation~~ FIXED  
- ~~^^ it was slow and annoying ... that was the intention.~~ FIXED  
- ~~The database and application are on the same instance, neither can scale without the other~~ FIXED  
- ~~The database of the application is on an instance, scaling IN/OUT risks this media~~ FIXED  
- ~~The application media and UI store is local to an instance, scaling IN/OUT risks this media~~ FIXED  
- ~~Customer Connections are to an instance directly ... no health checks/auto healing~~ FIXED
- ~~The IP of the instance is hardcoded into the database ....~~ FIXED


You can now move onto STAGE6 which is the cleanup step.
