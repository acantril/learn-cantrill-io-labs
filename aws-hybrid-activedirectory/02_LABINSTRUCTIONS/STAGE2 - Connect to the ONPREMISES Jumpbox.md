# STAGE 2A - Install a MS Remote Desktop Application

macOS : https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12  
Windows : built in, Search for `Remote Desktop`  
Linux : Various 3rd party solutions available   

# STAGE 2B - Locate the Jumpbox Details  

Open https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#Instances:sort=tag:Name  
Select `JumpBox`  
Locate the `Public DNS (IPv4)` for the Jumpbox and note down the DNS name  
Right Click and Select `Connect`
Select `RDP Client`
Click on `Get Password` 
Click on `Choose file`
Locate the `A4L.pem` key pair file you downloaded earlier and click `Open`
Click `Decrypt Password`
Note down the `User name` it should be `Administrator` (note this down as JumpBox Username)    

# STAGE 2C - Connect to the Jumpbox  

Use the remote desktop application to connect to the Jumpbox  
You will need :-  
- server address (this might be called differently, its the `Public DNS` value above)   
- Username ... should be `Administrator`  
- Password ... the `Jumpbox Password` you noted down above  

If there are any resolution settings `DONT` use fullscreen and set a resolution lower than your screen resolution (so you can see the instructions)  

# STAGE 2D - Record the other connection information for other instances  

Open https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#Instances:sort=tag:Name  

For each of the following instances :-  

- Client  
- FileServer  
- DC1  
- DC2  

Record the value from `Private IPs` in the EC2 console, and record which Instance name it relates to.  

e.g. DC1 PrivateIP `192.168.12.5` (make sure you use your own private IPs)  

# STAGE 2E - Connect to the 'client' instance  
This instance simulates a client machine within the A4L Onpremises environment  
Click `windows start button`  
Type `mstsc` or `remote desktop`  
Open the application  
connect to `Client` by entering the PrivateIP for `Client` you noted down above in the `computer` box  
Username `Admin@ad.animals4life.org`  
Password `YOUR_DOMAIN_ADMIN_PASSWORD`  
Click `OK`  
Answer `Yes` to ID/Certificate warning  
Move the RDP tab at the top to the far left ... this will mean when closing things down... you know which is your connection to the client machine ...   

# STAGE 2F - Browse to the A4L FileServer  

From the Client instance  
Click Start ... type \\FileServer\A4LFiles  
See that we have a (small) FileShare here
